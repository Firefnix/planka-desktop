# Planka

## What is this project?
Planka is a Trello-like kanban board built with React and Redux.

This is a desktop bundle of Planka. Usuallly, this app is used in a web
browser, but I wanted to use it in an app that:
 - Is faster to open than a whole web browser
 - Only has Planka in it
 - Is standalone

These are the reasons why I made this.

## Technologies used
Made in C using the GTK+3 framework.
